## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

Ministry of Environment

## Idea
Location-Based Search: Users can enter their location (ZIP code, city, or use geolocation) to find nearby e-waste collection and recycling facilities.
Interactive Map: The website features an interactive map displaying the locations of e-waste facilities, making it easy for users to visualize and choose the nearest one.
Educational Resources: Pop-ups or informational banners provide educational content on the harmful components of e-waste and their environmental and health impacts. Users can learn about the importance of proper disposal and recycling.
Device Input for Rewards: Users can input the model or type of their old electronic devices. Based on this information, they receive estimates on the amount of precious metals and other valuable materials that could be recovered through proper recycling.
Reward Points System: Users earn reward points for each device they input, relative to the estimated amount of materials recovered. These points can be redeemed for discounts or incentives at participating e-waste facilities or retailers.
Partner Integration: The website partners with e-waste recycling facilities, manufacturers, retailers, and other stakeholders to provide accurate information about drop-off locations, recycling programs, and accepted devices.
User Accounts: Users can create accounts to track their recycling history, view accumulated reward points, and receive personalized recommendations for responsible e-waste disposal.
Community Engagement: The website includes forums, discussion boards, or social media integration where users can share experiences, ask questions, and participate in community initiatives related to e-waste recycling.
Mobile App Compatibility: EcoRecycle Locator also offers a mobile app for on-the-go access to e-waste recycling information, making it convenient for users to find nearby facilities from their smartphones.

Earning Rewards for Recycling: Users who want to dispose of their old electronic devices responsibly can input the model or type of their devices into the website to estimate the amount of precious metals and other materials that can be recovered through recycling. They earn reward points for each device they input, which can be redeemed for discounts or incentives at participating e-waste facilities or retailers.
Tracking Recycling History: Users who create accounts on the website can track their recycling history and view accumulated reward points. They can see a record of the devices they've recycled and the rewards they've earned, helping them stay motivated to recycle more.
Engaging with the Community: Users who want to connect with others who are passionate about e-waste recycling can participate in the website's community forums, discussion boards, or social media channels.
